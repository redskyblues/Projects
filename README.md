# Projects
This is a collection of some of the programming projects I have worked on.

<b>(in progress) IMDB Sentiment Analysis (PyTorch)</b>

- I am working of training a sentiment analysis model on a database of IMDB reviews using PyTorch.

<b>Accent Classification NLP Project (TensorFlow)</b>

- Trained a neural network to classify nine English-speaking accents in the large AccentDB dataset. Achieved a test-set accuracy of >95% by optimising model architecture to reduce overfitting.

<b>Integrated Design Project (Arduino)</b>

- Developed a robot that competed to navigate a course by identifying requirements and solving technical challenges with Arduino. 

<b>Flood warning system (Python)</b>

- I completed this project in Apr 2021 in collaboration with a partner. The program fetches live weather station data and can give an analysis on the risk of a flood.
